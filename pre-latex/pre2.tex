\section{
  Introduction
 }
\label{sec:Intro}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} experiment is to analyze the electric field of
the line charge in a free space. And the objectives of this experiment is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the distribution of electric field
          built by continuous line charge
    \item Plot the relevant figures on MATLAB environment
    \item Study the difference betweenintegration and infinitesimal methodson
          on analyzing electric field.
\end{itemize}\par

By using the scientific analysis software MATLAB,
simulated the electric field distribution of
line charge in a 2-D rectangular coordinate can help us to
understand the electric field in a visualized way.\par

Suppose there is a uniformly distributed line charge
between point A(-1,0) and point B(1,0),
with line charge density of $\rho = 1 \times 10^{-9}$ C/m.
(The unit for the coordinate is m)\par

Using integration method in \ref{ method:integration }
to calculate the electric potential at each point of the coordinate,
we can get the real distribution in theory.
And using infinitesimal method in \ref{ method:infinitesimal }
to do a approximate simulation.\par

To describe the distribution, I use three graph included for each method.
They include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item i)   the distribution of electric field for each point;
    \item ii)  equipotential lines;
    \item iii) distribution of electric field lines(represented by continuous lines).
\end{itemize}\par
To analyze the difference, I calculate the difference of electric potential
between two ways at three different degree of seperation(20, 50 and 100).
Draw the graph of difference distribution.
And analyzed the difference at line: $y = 0.1$,
using knowledge of calculus to describe the difference.

\section{
  Related Knowledge and Functions

\label{sec:Related and Func}

In vaccuum, the electric field intensity ($\mathbf{E}$)
of a point charge can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E} = k\frac{Q}{R^2}\mathbf{a}_R
\end{equation}

Where the coefficient $k = 9 \times 10^9$ F/m is the electrostatic constant.
$Q$ represent the total amount of charges. $R$ denotes the distance
between the point in the electric field and the source charge.\par

If we take reference point as the infinite distance, then the electric potential at
a point in the field is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    V = k \frac{Q}{R}
\end{equation}

The electric field intensity can be expressed as the negative gradient of
the electric potential:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E} = -\nabla V
\end{equation}

The electric field generated by N point charge in the vaccuum is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    V = \sum_{i=1}^N k\frac{Q_i}{R_i}
\end{equation}

Similarly, the field magnitude generated by N point charges in the vaccuum can
be obtained through equation (3).\par

When the field source is continuous charge, e.g. line charge, we can readily resolve it
by using infinitesimal or integral method. the procedure of applying this method is
listed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1) Divide the line charge into small segments of charges
          (usuallybeingdivided evenly).
    \item 2) Treat eachsmall segment of charges as a point charge and
          calculate the electric potential through equation (2).
    \item 3) Sum  up  all  the  electric  potential by using  equation  (4)
          to  obtain  the  electric potential.
    \item 4) Calculatethe electric field intensity generated by
          this line charge through equation (3).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{
    integration method
}\label{
    method:integration
}
Using integration method to calculate the distribution of electric potential
at each point of the coordinate, namely, the real distribution.
The procedure is given below:\\
Given a point $(X_0, Y_0)$:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        V= & \  k\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{\rho dx}{R}                                     \\
        =  & \ k\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{\rho dx}{\sqrt{(x-X_0)^2+Y_0^2}}                 \\
        =  & \ k \rho \ln{\left | (x-X_0)+\sqrt{(x-X_0)^2+Y_0^2} \right \|_{-1}^1  } \\
        =  & \  k \rho \ln{\left(
            \frac{1-X_0+\sqrt{(1-X_0)^2+Y_0^2}}{-1-X_0+\sqrt{(-1-X_0)^2+Y_0^2}}
            \right)}                                                                 \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If we calculate each point of the coordinate.

\begin{equation}
    V(x,y)=k\rho\ln{\left(
        \frac{1-x+\sqrt{(1-x)^2+y^2}}{-1-x+\sqrt{(-1-x)^2+y^2}}
        \right)}
\end{equation}

Easy to prove, when calculated point is on the line charge, namely, $x\in[-1,1]$ and $y = 0$,
the electric potential is $\infty$.

\subsection{
    infinitesimal method
}\label{
    method:infinitesimal
}

Using infinitesimal method to calculate the distribution of electric potential
at each point of the coordinate, however, we cannot have infinitesimal in MATLAB,
so we use small segments as infinitesimal.\par
Set the approximative infinitesimal of distance is $\Delta x = \frac{l}{N}$.
Where l is the length of line charge $l = x_A - x_B = 2$, N is number of segments.
Using point charge to replace the segments,
so the x-coordinates are the midpoints of the segments.
Each x-coordinate is $x_i = i\frac{\Delta x}{2} + x_A = \frac{i}{N} - 1$
So, the approximate infinitesimal of charge is $\Delta Q = \rho \Delta x$.
According to equation (4), given a point $(X_0, Y_0)$:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        V = & \ \sum_{i=1}^N k\frac{\Delta Q}{R_i}                                             \\
        =   & \ k\rho \Delta x\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x_i - X_0)^2+Y_0^2}}                \\
        =   & \ k\rho \frac{l}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{i}{N} - 1 - X_0)^2+Y_0^2}} \\
        =   & \ \frac{2k\rho}{N}
        \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{i}{N} - X_0 - 1)^2+Y_0^2}}                          \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If we calculate each point of the coordinate.
\begin{equation}
    V(x,y) = \frac{2k\rho}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\frac{i}{N} - x - 1)^2+y^2}} \\
\end{equation}

As Figure~\ref{fig:1.2} shows that, the Isopotential lines are ellipse.
And where the coordinates is far from line charge, the isopotential lines is being more round.
It is means that the potential distribution of a short line charge
is close to point charge in some ways.

\section{
  Analyze the Difference between two Methods
 }
\label{sec:diff}

1. Initialization. Set coordinates as \ref{sec:inte} and \ref{sec:inf}.
And the real distribution of electric distribution $V_1$ will not change.
\lstinputlisting[lastline = 16]{../hw2/work3.m}

2. Draw difference of electric potential distribution between two methods to Figure~\ref{fig:3.1}.
\lstinputlisting[firstline = 19, lastline = 32]{../hw2/work3.m}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \subfigure[N = 20]{

    \caption{Difference between two distributions of electric potential}
    \label{fig:3.1}
\end{figure}
According to Figure~\ref{fig:3.1}, the bigger N is, the smaller difference is.
And the biggest difference is around the endpoints of the line charge.\\
\\
For the electric potential on the line charge is infinite,
the line near the line charge to analyze the difference is a great choice,
specifically, let $x \in [-4,4]$, $y = 0.1$.
When $N = 20$, the difference is bigger, so come from the situation of N = 20 for infinitesimal method.\par

\lstinputlisting[firstline = 34, lastline = 60]{../hw2/work3.m}

    \includegraphics[width = 3.4in]{figures-2/fig3.2.eps}
    \caption{Simulation at y = 0.1}
    \label{fig:3.2}
\end{figure}

If we calculate the equation of the distance to the line charge at point P $(0, 0.1)$,
According to equation (5) we can get dV/dx of P is:
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{dV}{dx} = \frac{k \rho}{\sqrt{x^2+0.1^2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        V(x) = & \ \int{\frac{k \rho}{\sqrt{x^2+0.1^2}}}       \\
        =      & \ \ln(\left| sqrt(100x^2+1) +10x \right|) + C
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Draw the figure of dV/dx and the rectangular areas formed
depart x axis to N segments, using the middle point's value as height,
make rectangular area (width id dx ,the length of segments),
to replace the area of function and x-axis in the same width.

According to Figure~\ref{fig:3.3} bule function is the real value of
Can be proved, when $dx = l / N$ approximate to 0, N approximate infinity,
the integration between real value and infinitesimal will be small.\\

The error ($\epsilon$) from real value to approximative value is:
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_i =\left| k\int_{t}^{t+\Delta x} \frac{\rho dx}{R} -  \frac{k \rho \Delta x}{\sqrt{(t - \frac{\Delta x}{2})^2 + 0.01}} \right |

\end{equation}

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

$\epsilon \approx 210$;

From Table~\ref{tab:error1}, each rectangular area has difference of the trapezoid with curve side,
so if the curve is bended more seriously, then the error will be increase.
That is affected by the degree of seperation, because for a smaller distance, the bend level is lower.
